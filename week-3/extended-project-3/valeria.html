    <h1><font color="midnightblue">About Valeria</font></h1>
    <h3>What are some honest, unfiltered things about you?</h3>
    I worry too much. I really pay attention to the details, so be careful!
    <h3>What drives you nuts?</h3>
    When people make some noises that bother me (e.g. screeching) <i>on purpose</i>
    <h4>How can people earn an extra gold star with you?</h3>
    Be honest. Be friendly. Don't be selfish nor arrogant. 
    <h3>
      What are some things that people might misunderstand about you that you
      should clarify?
    </h3>
    I <i>swear</i> I'm not mad at you! My personality and my face are just like that!
    <h3>What's the best way to convince you to do something?</h3>
    Give me <b><u>facts</u></b>.
    <h3>How do you like to get feedback?</h3>
    Definitely not face to face. I mean... I can deal with it, yes, but I still feel kind of uncomfortable. I'll get better at it, I promise!
